# project1
For final assignment project 1
This Project 1 takes the current time and let's you add 1 hours and minutes to the current time and displays the time on screen (in 24 hour and 12 hour format). This code does a great job of keeping track of what time it will be after a certian time the end user selects.


# Future Improvements
  -Takes the current time like the client wished
  -Shows a clock on screen to help end users visualize how this could be used in their program


  # Challenges
  - creating a code that could quickly give an output to the user and retain the data
  - I was able to research this issue and look for tips on improving my code through various only resources
  - In future I will be adding r/learnprograming reddit page to my helpful resources

    # Skills gained
  - I will use the increased problem solving skill gained from this project to help me maintain adapt and make the code more readable to end users
